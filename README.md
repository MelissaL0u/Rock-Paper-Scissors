# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Project started on October 13, 2024. 
Will be taking my time with this project, as to not burn out on TOP itself.
This is to create a computerized version of the game Rock Paper Scissors. The user is meant to play against the computer for a set amount of rounds(5).

After reading the directions fully, I have written my psuedocode and began working on the Javascript file.
Computer prompt is written. Human prompt is also written. Both compile well.

Completed code

Psuedocode:
When user inputs an initial response of rock, paper or scissor in console
    Prompt for user input
    User must input rock paper or scissors
Computer intializes response of rock, paper or scissor
    Each response must be given a value at random
    Random number genrated will equal response given
    Rock 0<=x>=3
    Paper 4<=x>=6
    Scissors 7<=x>9
Logic for a single round
    Playable round must be made into function
    Function must call both human and computer answers
    Make sure human answer isn't case sensitive
    Create winning scenarios based off of answers

Rules of the Game:

Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats rock
