# Rock-Paper-Scissors
Project started on October 13, 2024. 
Will be taking my time with this project, as to not burn out on TOP itself.
This is to create a computerized version of the game Rock Paper Scissors. The user is meant to play against the computer for a set amount of rounds(5).

After reading the directions fully, I have written my psuedocode and began working on the Javascript file.
Computer code is written.

Psuedocode:
When user inputs an initial response of rock, paper or scissor in console

Computer intializes response of rock, paper or scissor
    Each response must be given a value at random
    Random number genrated will equal response given
    Rock 0<=x>=0.33
    Paper 0.34<=x>=0.67
    Scissors 0.68<=x>1

Rules of the Game:
Rock beats Scissors
Scissors beats Paper
Paper beats rock
